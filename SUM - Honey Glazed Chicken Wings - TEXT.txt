Honey Glazed Chicken Wings

How to make Honey Glazed Chicken Wings:
It’s incredibly easy! All you’ll do is combine the honey glaze ingredients and pour it over the chicken wings in a casserole dish.  Then you’ll bake the wings for an hour until the chicken is cooked through.  That’s it!

How to trim chicken wings:
Sometimes you can buy wings already cut up at the store.  They’ll be more expensive that way. When you buy whole wings, you can cut them yourself. This means they need to be trimmed in three parts. All you’ll need is a pair of sharp kitchen scissors or a sharp knife. If you stretch out the whole wing, you will see that there are three parts to the wing (the wing tip, the wingette and the drumstick). When you stretch out the wing, you should be able to see the three joints.  Cut off the tip to separate it from the wingette.  You can discard the tips (or put them in a zip baggie and freeze them for making chicken stock at a later time). And then cut between the wingette and the drumstick. You’ll use the wingettes and drumsticks to make this honey glazed chicken wings recipe.
